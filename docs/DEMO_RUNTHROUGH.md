# Service Design Tool — Demo Runthrough Guide

A structured flow for demonstrating the tool to stakeholders. Estimated time: 15–20 minutes.

## Overview

**Part 1 (5–7 min):** Blank project — core mechanics  
**Part 2 (10–15 min):** Demo mode — guided creation + advanced features + AI

---

## Part 1: Blank Project — Core Mechanics

Start from the projects list. Create a new project and show the basics.

### 1. Create a New Project
- Click **New Project**
- Enter a name (e.g. "Contact Centre Redesign")
- Optional: add a short description
- Click **Create**

### 2. Journey Map Basics

**Create a journey map**
- Click **New Map**
- In the chooser modal, select **Start blank**
- Name it (e.g. "Customer Enquiry Journey")

**Add phases**
- Hover over the phase header band
- Use the **+** buttons to add phases before/after
- Add 2–3 phases (e.g. "Discover", "Submit", "Follow up")
- Click phase titles to edit names and timeframes

**Add actions**
- Hover over an action column header
- Use the **+** buttons to add actions before/after
- Add 2–3 actions per phase
- Click action titles to edit

**Edit cells**
- Click any cell to edit (description, emotion, channel, touchpoint)
- Show the emotion trend line updating as you change emotion values
- Add a pain point or opportunity in the yellow/green cards

### 3. Service Blueprint Basics

**Create a blueprint**
- Click **New Blueprint**
- In the chooser modal, select **Start blank**
- Name it (e.g. "Enquiry Handling Blueprint")

**Add structure**
- Add phases (e.g. "Submit", "Triage", "Resolve")
- Add columns within phases (hover and use **+**)
- Show the 5-lane structure: Physical Evidence, Customer Action, Frontstage, Backstage, Support Process

**Add cards**
- Add **Basic Cards** in Physical Evidence, Customer Action, Support Process
- Add **Complex Cards** in Frontstage/Backstage (create a team first if needed)
- Add a **Decision Card** to show branching logic
- Connect cards with connectors (drag between cards)

### 4. Quick Tour of Other Features
- **Personas:** Create a persona and link it to the journey map
- **Comments:** Right-click any cell → Add comment → show floating comment icons
- **Export:** Export as PDF or PNG
- **Version History:** Create a snapshot for comparison

## Part 2: Demo Mode — Guided Creation, Advanced Features & AI

After Part 1, click the **Demo** button in the left navigation rail to enter **Demo mode** (seeds a demo project and enables scripted “AI” flows).

### 1. Demo mode setup (30–60s)
- Explain: “In Demo mode, the tool guides us step-by-step and generates artifacts quickly from structured input.”
- Navigate to the demo project overview (starts empty — no journey maps or blueprints yet).

### 2. Evidence-first: Research upload — Journey Map (2–3 min)
Goal: show that **Current State** can be grounded in real notes before we design the **Future State**.

- Click **New Map** and choose **Create from research notes**
- In **Upload files** mode: click the upload area to load demo interview files (p1_summary, p2_transcript)
- Or switch to **Paste text** and paste notes
- Add artifact name and persona label (click to fill in demo mode)
- Click **Tag & generate**, adjust tags, then **Create draft artifact**
- Result: Journey Map created from research evidence

### 3. Guided persona builder (1–2 min)
- In the **Personas** section, click **Guided**
- Fields start blank; **click into each step's field** to populate with demo content
- Finish and highlight the generated **watch-outs** (stored in persona notes)

### 4. Guided setup — Service Blueprint (3–5 min)
- Click **New Blueprint** → **Guided setup**
- Answer the chat questions (click into the input to fill with demo answers)
- Review the draft preview
- Click **Create Current State**
- Result: Service Blueprint created

### 5. Completeness checklist (60–90s)
- Open the Journey Map → click **Completeness**
- Show how it explains what’s missing (and why it matters)
- Repeat quickly on the Service Blueprint

### 6. Per-artifact AI chat + thumbnails (2–3 min)
**Journey Map**
- Open the AI sidebar
- Ask (or use suggested prompts):
  1. **Generate thumbnails for this journey map**
  2. **Summarise the biggest pain points**
  3. **Show me where the customer has to repeat themselves**

### 7. Guided Future State (constraints-first) + Compare (3–5 min)
Do Future State after Current State is evidence-based and reviewed.

**Journey Map**
- From the wizard (or AI sidebar), choose **Generate Future State (guided)**
- Capture constraints (budget/time/tech), what must stay, what can change, success metrics
- Create the Future State artifact
- Open **Compare** to show Current vs Future side-by-side

**Service Blueprint**
- Repeat the same Future State flow (guided constraints → create)
- Use **Compare** again

### 8. Fast mentions / optional add-ons (2–4 min total)
Use these as quick “capabilities” rather than deep dives unless asked:
- **Templates library:** New Map/Blueprint → **Start from a template** (show 1 template)
- **Facilitation mode:** open it briefly, add 1–2 stickies, show voting, then “Generate artifact”
- **Version History:** create a snapshot (“Before redesign”), then one after changes
- **Share:** generate a share link (describe password protection if relevant)
- **Export:** export a Journey Map or Blueprint
- **Comments:** add 1 comment and show it anchors to the cell/card

### 9. Wrap-up (30s)
- Re-state the story: **evidence → current state → completeness → AI enrichment → constrained future state → compare**

## Tips for Presenters

- **Demo fields:** In Part 2, all guided fields start blank. Click into any field to populate it with demo content — no typing required.
- **Pace:** Keep Part 1 brisk; focus Part 2 on the AI flow.
- **Interaction:** Use suggested prompts rather than typing.
- **Order:** Keep “evidence → current state” before “future state” to maintain credibility.
- **Don’t overbuild live:** Use “fast mentions” for templates/facilitation/version/share/export unless the audience asks.
- **Questions:** If stakeholders ask about a feature, use the demo project to show it.
- **Fallback:** If AI or generation fails, use Version History and Export to show value.
